/**
 * The time complexity of an algorithm estimates how much time the algorithm will use for a given input.
 * A time complexity is denoted O(...) where the three dots represent some func- tion. Usually, the 
 * variable n denotes the input size.
 * 
 * O(1)         The running time of a constant-time algorithm does not depend on the input size.
 * O(logn)      A logarithmic algorithm often halves the input size at each step. The running time of such an 
 *              algorithm is logarithmic, because log2 n equals the number of times n must be divided by 2 to get 1.
 * O(sqrt_n)    A square root algorithm is slower than O(log n) but faster than O(n).
 * O(n)         A linear algorithm goes through the input a constant number of times. 
 * O(n log n)   This time complexity often indicates that the algorithm sorts the input, because the time complexity 
 *              of efficient sorting algorithms is O(n log n). Another possibility is that the algorithm uses a 
 *              data structure where each operation takes O(log n) time.
 * O(n^2)       A quadratic algorithm often contains two nested loops.
 * O(n^3)       A cubic algorithm often contains three nested loops.
 * O(2^n)       This time complexity often indicates that the algorithm iterates through all subsets of the input elements.
 *              For example, the subsets of {1, 2, 3} are âˆ…, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, and {1, 2, 3}.
 * O(n!)        This time complexity often indicates that the algorithm iterates through all permutations of the input elements. 
 *              For example, the permutations of {1, 2, 3} are (1,2,3), (1,3,2), (2,1,3), (2,3,1), (3,1,2), and (3,2,1).
 * 
 * NP-hard problems are an important set of problems, for which no polynomial algorithm is known.
